# Real data approach for contagion probabilities: COVID-19 and dengue

In this repository, we present the real data and results of the new contagion probabilities:

1. The real data for COVID-19 (in Germany and South Korea) and Dengue (two localities in Colombia). 
2. The live script in Matlab 2021a for parameter estimation of COVID-19 and Dengue cases.
3. All parameters family resulted from the estimations
